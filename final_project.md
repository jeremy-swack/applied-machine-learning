## Abstract

As said by Chinese investor Connie Chan, “TikTok is the first mainstream consumer app where artificial intelligence IS the product.” Anyone who has used the social media platform can attest to this; the main feature of the app is the incredibly powerful recommendation engine known as the “For You Page.” TikTok learns a user’s interests using a variety of different data to allow the app to almost always recommend a video that the user will enjoy. This has led to TikTok having one of the longest retention times of any app, beating out social media titans like Facebook and Instagram. 

Although TikTok has not released the specifics of their algorithm, many have theorized how it works. For TikTok to recommend a video to users, it needs to know who to push it out to. It is likely that TikTok uses a variety of machine learning techniques to extract as much information as possible from a video. For this project, I want to try and replicate these techniques to find what makes a TikTok go viral.
